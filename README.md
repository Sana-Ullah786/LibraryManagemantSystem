## Redis Setup for Windows

Redis is not officially supported by Windows, but there is a workaround using which it can be installed.
Follow the steps on this link: https://riptutorial.com/redis/example/29962/installing-and-running-redis-server-on-windows

You will have to run the redis-server.exe file before running this project. The REDIS_HOST and/or REDIS_PORT are to be updated in the env file if they are different.
